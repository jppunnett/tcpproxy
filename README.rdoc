tcpproxy was inspired by Alexander Demin's article:
{The Beauty of Concurrency in Go}[http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-06/the-beauty-of-concurrency-in-go]

tcpproxy is a very simple Ruby program that implements a TCP/IP proxy server.
This is not production software :-) I built it to explore a number of Ruby features:
* Threads
* Sockets
* Command Line Interfaces (CLI)

For CLI, I used the excellent David Copeland's {Methadone Library}[https://github.com/davetron5000/methadone].
Buy the book as well: {Build Awesome Command Line Applications in Ruby}[http://pragprog.com/book/dccar/build-awesome-command-line-applications-in-ruby].

== Install
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'tcpproxy'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tcpproxy


== Examples
In the following example, tcpproxy listens on port 8888 for connections to google.com. At the end of the session, you'll find details about the conversation in a file named, tcpproxy_datetime.log, where datetime is the date and time of the conversation between client and server.

   ruby tcpproxy google.com:80
